Exploring github. 

Hey friends. Having a background in both non-profit and ministry program devlepment and team building I started to become acutely aware of a significant lack of how technology can be used in the workplace. This led to a passion to explore ways to bring the power of technology more effectively into the work I was doing. So I went back to the basics - understanding how computers work. This very quickly opened doors to start learning coding languages. I'm still green but excited to continue down this journey.
